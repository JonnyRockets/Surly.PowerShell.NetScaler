# Contributing to Surly.PowerShell.NetScalerThanks for considering to contribute to the Surly.PowerShell.NetScaler project.  ## Simple Guidelines1. Never fork the master repo.  Fork the dev branch.  Pull requests straight to master will be rejected (but in a nice way).2. Use the [Allman style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) for coding.  If you don't I'll probably update your pull request :)3. Make sure to include comment based help on any new functions4. Make sure to update comment based help on major changes5. Pester tests should be added to the Source\Tests folder (Pester has not been implemented at this time)## Issues and when to use themIf you are correcting a problem you've found in the current code, pleaes create an issue.  Then fork the dev branch, make your corrections and issue a pull request referencing the issue number.## Publish-ModuleI use another script called [Publish-Module](https://github.com/martin9700/Publish-Module) to create the module files.  When I'm ready to commit changes to master I'll run Publish-Module to create the Module and Manifest and then pull it into the master.
